Notes:

	The error handling in parser.as is so detailed because we are writing the json files
	by hand right now. Upon later automation, the detailed checks will be removed,
	and a simple yes/no parseable output will be displayed.
	
	Switching mod in editor gui will throw away all unsaved changes. No save dialogue
	
	
Later Testing:

	Check if Workshop Mod also applies to TGR mods that have been uploaded but are loaded locally
	
	
Future:

	Possibility to view the preview again after 5 minutes?
	Maybe not for the first statue, but have an indicator on the GUI? (Hotkey/Button?)
		Unsure because it's not intended for a level to have more than 10-15 statues max.
		Otherwise it would be way too overloaded if the level is big.
