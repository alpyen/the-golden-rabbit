Changelog:

Added "Congratulations" screen at the end (after finding the last statue)
Removed pausing the previews for anti-cheat measures, pausing will stop the game timer from counting up though

Removed ReadLevelJsonFromMod (not needed)

Editor works fine now (with the mods in Documents, not intended for ProgramFiles mods)

Core levels flagged overridable

-----

Write README.md after mod is published

Remove any logging on release

Add message interface for other mods to interface with TGR

Notes:

	The error handling in parser.as is so detailed because we are writing the json files
	by hand right now. Upon later automation, the detailed checks will be removed,
	and a simple yes/no parseable output will be displayed.
	
	Switching mod in editor gui will throw away all unsaved changes. No save dialogue
	
	
Later Testing:

	Check if Workshop Mod also applies to TGR mods that have been uploaded but are loaded locally
	
	
Future:

	Possibility to view the preview again after 5 minutes?
	Maybe not for the first statue, but have an indicator on the GUI? (Hotkey/Button?)
		Unsure because it's not intended for a level to have more than 10-15 statues max.
		Otherwise it would be way too overloaded if the level is big.
