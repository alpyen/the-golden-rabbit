ToDo-List:

Complete mod.xml

Write README.md

Account for the rotation of the statue in the .tgr files.

Add own resizing instaed of doScreenResize()

Account for camera FOV (use specific FOV for preview, and reset afterwards)

Implement messag reset (status preview running = false etc) only resetting everything for now because devphase

freeze characters during preview and set the correct static values back

Copy the custom ImGuiGetTime function from other mod with is_paused.
the preview should pause ifthe game is paused too!

camera might glitch around during preview and jumping into the editor with f1

Check .tgr file for correct syntax and semantics after JSON.parseFile.
Remove elements and output warnings/errors on incorrect elements.
Parse file afterwards

Add directory scanning for .tgr files.
Add automatic parsing for the scanned files.






Add automatic/easy way of creating new .tgr files.



Notes:

	The error handling in parser.as is so detailed because we are writing the json files
	by hand right now. Upon later automation, the detailed checks will be removed,
	and a simple yes/no parseable output will be displayed.
