Add a winning screen for the level (Congrats etc)

Write README.md

Remove the possibility to modify the mods own levels later on. This is just for debug purposes!

Notes:

	The error handling in parser.as is so detailed because we are writing the json files
	by hand right now. Upon later automation, the detailed checks will be removed,
	and a simple yes/no parseable output will be displayed.
