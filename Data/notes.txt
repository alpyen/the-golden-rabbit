Changelog:


-----

Set the tgr levels of the mod itself overridable later on
 Levels created with the mod are non-overridable be default!


Add a winning screen for the level (Congrats etc)

Write README.md

Remove ReadLevelJsonFromMod if not needed

Severe error in editor, the statues of the currently loaded mod are displayed
in the listbox, not the one that is being edited!!

Add message interface for other mods to interface with TGR

Remove the possibility to modify the mods own levels later on. This is just for debug purposes!

Exit preview immediately when the pause menu opens, otherwise people can cheat

Notes:

	The error handling in parser.as is so detailed because we are writing the json files
	by hand right now. Upon later automation, the detailed checks will be removed,
	and a simple yes/no parseable output will be displayed.
	
	Switching mod in editor gui will throw away all unsaved changes. No save dialogue
	
	
Later Testing:

	Check if Workshop Mod also applies to TGR mods that have been uploaded but are loaded locally
