ToDo-List:

Complete mod.xml

Write README.md

Check .tgr file for correct syntax and semantics after JSON.parseFile.
Remove elements and output warnings/errors on incorrect elements.
Parse file afterwards

Add directory scanning for .tgr files.
Add automatic parsing for the scanned files.






Add automatic/easy way of creating new .tgr files.



Notes:

	The error handling in parser.as is so detailed because we are writing the json files
	by hand right now. Upon later automation, the detailed checks will be removed,
	and a simple yes/no parseable output will be displayed.
