make an own statue with no collision flag?

can you full reset while pasusing? YES

Check if a mod is a local mod and only display those because otherwise the pathing might break.
We are writing directly to Data/Mods/mod-id/Data/TheGoldenRabbit/mod-id/custom.tgr
Also editing steam workshop stuff is dangerous and not good.


Why does saving the JSON take that long?


Complete mod.xml

Write README.md


Add and finish Level Editor


Implement a decent reset routine.

	If you reset while fading then the fading should be removed and the player should continue on the state.
	If he was searching, then keep him in searching, if the level has no tgr data, stay in LSS_DO_NOTHING.
	
	Menu-Retry or Death should not reset the whole level.



Fix animation to 36 frames (0dg, 10dg, .... 350dg), it's 35 frames now.
Don't forget to adjust the loop limit to more one!!

camera might glitch around during preview and jumping into the editor with f1


Notes:

	The error handling in parser.as is so detailed because we are writing the json files
	by hand right now. Upon later automation, the detailed checks will be removed,
	and a simple yes/no parseable output will be displayed.
