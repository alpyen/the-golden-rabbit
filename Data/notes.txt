Changelog:

Created a non-collidable version of the rabbit statue and replaced the original.

Bugfix, Starting a dialogue while LSS_STATUE_WAS_FOUND or LSS_FADE_... was running.

Decent Reset routine was implemented.

UI Rabbit Statue Animation Fixed

Switching to editor will not mess with the camera anymore,
unfortunetaly this messed quite a lot with the code so it might need to be
refactored later on.

Notes:

	The error handling in parser.as is so detailed because we are writing the json files
	by hand right now. Upon later automation, the detailed checks will be removed,
	and a simple yes/no parseable output will be displayed.
