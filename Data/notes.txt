ToDo-List:

Complete mod.xml

Dying in a level with checkpoints should not reset the statue to the very first position.

make the mod's own level overridable


Fix animation to 36 frames (0dg, 10dg, .... 350dg), it's 35 frames now.
Don't forget to adjust the loop limit to more one!!


camera might glitch around during preview and jumping into the editor with f1


Add directory scanning for .tgr files.
Add automatic parsing for the scanned files.


add mod menu


Add automatic/easy way of creating new .tgr files.


Notes:

	The error handling in parser.as is so detailed because we are writing the json files
	by hand right now. Upon later automation, the detailed checks will be removed,
	and a simple yes/no parseable output will be displayed.
